#The Circumpolar World

This repository contains historical and descriptive material for a notional world: a deindustrial future extended ca. 500 years from present, centered on the emergent maritime civilization of the no longer icebound Polar (Arctic) Ocean.

This world was originally devised as a setting for the stories in (https://github.com/whblondeau/memoria-interna). It grew, as invented worlds tend to, when I started exploring implications and sketching out the historical developments that might result in the situation described in the stories.

Some of the content of this repository was originally publicly available in the Memoria Interna repository. It was moved to this repository to distinguish between the stories I write and the background material underpinning the world. Partly that was intended to keep things organizationally simple; but the primary purpose was to permit a difference in intellectual property status between the two kinds of content.

##Intellectual Property Issues (Non-Normative)
Explanations in this section are not legally binding. The official license is authoritative in all respects.

The stories I write about the world herein detailed remain by default under the ordinary form of copyright: all rights reserved. To the extent determined by applicable law, that applies to the events, the characters, and the verbal content of the stories. Any deviation from that will be noted in the story's published form.

The background material in this repository, on the other hand, is released under a modified [Creative Commons Attribution License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license). The modifications to this license primarily establish this repository's primacy as the canonical representation of described world, and the specific role of the GitHub pull request in identifying cononical contributions.

The license does not inhibit individuals from creating content—either creative or explanatory—pertaining to the world defined in this repository, and it asserts no specific rights over such derivative content. In other words, release of this world's background content is intended to establish a [shared universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_universe).

The purpose of the strict distinction between widely permissive encouragement of derivative work, and strict attribution of canon, is simple: to make any third-party contributions to this notional world as frictionless as possible, without damaging the integrity of the world itself. 



With the equatorial regions closed to human habitation, and the former "temperate zones" grown very much intemperate, the melting of the Arctic ice has shifted the core of human civilization to the coasts of the Polar Ocean. As has always been the case with a central sea of any kind, the Polar has become the maritime crossroads of the world. 

The peoples of the Polar Ocean are generally culturally vigorous. The primary constraint on their population size is the availability of food. Permaculture has been adapted, in many ingenious ways, to the weak insolation of the arctic circle. Also, the Polar Ocean is still in many regions ecologically alive, and a limited fishing industry is possible (although it took a number of wars to impose a sustainable regimen.) Still, food is not easily found.

The Circumpolar has a history of violent conflict, mostly triggered by contention for resources, but also by ideological conflict between Emergist thought and a number of other political organizing principles. Emergism - a stringent application of ecological and thermodynamic realities to economic and political theory - has become the politically dominant ideology in the Polar Ocean region, as well as having strong influence in the rest of the habitable northern hemisphere.
